<p><p>Matthew Ball on the coming <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">Metaverse</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in February of 2019, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite. It is also the driver behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among many, many other projects, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be spent on cloud gaming over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among its key features, Ball speculates, are persistence; synchronicity; concurrent participation across space; a straddling of online and offline worlds, open and closed platforms; and “unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences”.</p>
<p>The metaverse is not to be confused with “virtual reality”, “virtual space,” a game, or even “online experience itself”.</p>
<p>It will depend on a number of developments, including a greater &ldquo;concurrency infrastructure&rdquo; to host ever larger, mass, real-time events online; a more robust and resilient set of standards and protocols, narrowing the number of common file formats; and a more inviting set of “on-ramp experiences” to the ones that brought us online in the late 90s.</p>
<p>A fascinating vision of at least some of the changes at a macro level that we can expect to see in the evolution of digital and network tech in the coming decade or two.</p>
<p>One insight, among many, that stands out here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together.</p>
</blockquote>
