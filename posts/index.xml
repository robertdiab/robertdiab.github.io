      <title>The End of Passwords?</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/end-of-passwords/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 11:52:29 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In developer builds of its system updates, Apple is testing the new WebAuthn passkey standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s out of beta, it may make passwords obsolete, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Shankland at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-says-its-new-logon-tech-is-as-easy-as-passwords-but-far-more-secure/&#34;&gt;cnet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up an account on a website or app using a passkey, you first choose a username for the new account, then use FaceID or Touch ID to confirm that it&amp;rsquo;s really you who&amp;rsquo;s using the device. You don&amp;rsquo;t ever pick a password. Your device handles generation and storage of the passkey, which iCloud Keychain synchronizes across all your Apple devices. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech behind Apple&amp;rsquo;s passkeys is built on the WebAuthn technology that emerged from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fidoalliance.org&#34;&gt;FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a consortium that&amp;rsquo;s been overhauling authentication with hardware security keys. Apple&amp;rsquo;s approach embraces a fundamental part of WebAuthn, the combination of public and private encryption keys that&amp;rsquo;s already built deeply into communication security and many other established processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this helpful &lt;a href=&#34;https://webauthn.guide&#34;&gt;WebAuthn Guide&lt;/a&gt; explains, the new standard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…allows servers to integrate with the strong authenticators now built into devices, like Windows Hello or Apple’s Touch ID. Instead of a password, a private-public keypair (known as a credential) is created for a website. The private key is stored securely on the user’s device; a public key and randomly generated credential ID is sent to the server for storage. The server can then use that public key to prove the user’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public key is not secret, because it is effectively useless without the corresponding private key. The fact that the server receives no secret has far-reaching implications for the security of users and organizations. Databases are no longer as attractive to hackers, because the public keys aren’t useful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Apple will roll this out in the fall is unclear. But soon, they will, along with other members of the FIDO alliance behind the WebAuthn standard, including Google and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see encryption used in this ingenious way to make something so fundamental to our use of the web both more convenient and more secure. It&amp;rsquo;s rare that we get both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will iCloud Private Relay Make Us All Anonymous?</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/icloud-private-relay/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:37:58 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/icloud-private-relay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple has unveiled a new feature, on mobile platforms and the Mac, that offers more privacy than a VPN and more speed than Tor networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may well lead to a quantum leap in the amount of traffic online that becomes anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the most common options for concealing your tracks on the web were to use a virtual private network or Tor (an open source app involving a series of relay servers around the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VPN would shield your identity from your ISP or the sites you visit, but not from the VPN provider itself. You would have to trust the VPN with your info, or hope it wouldn’t be hacked. Using a Tor browser spared you from having to share info with a VPN, but the relay process that concealed your IP address made surfing slow and cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novelty of iCloud Private Relay is that no one has all the info necessary to tie your browsing history to your device or identity. Apple’s clever solution is to use a middleman, an unnamed set of ‘trusted content providers.’ You give certain information to Apple’s servers and they turn over &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of it to another set of servers that speak to the sites you wish to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dave Hamilton at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/digging-into-apples-icloud-private-relay/&#34;&gt;the Mac Observer&lt;/a&gt; puts it: “Apple doesn’t know what site(s) you’re visiting, and the third-party content provider doesn’t know who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in contrast to Tor, iCloud Private Relay doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause a noticeable slow down — according to early tests by Hamilton and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey&#34;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. Many, many people will likely turn it on and forget it&amp;rsquo;s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it mean that much more traffic will now be concealed more effectively than before? Will it make any difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it give some people more fodder to argue for back doors to encryption?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epic vs Apple and the Search for the Right Analogy</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/epic-v-apple/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 09:49:34 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/epic-v-apple/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As often happens in court cases in involving cyberspace, it all comes down to finding the right analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle Orland, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/the-epic-v-apple-case-could-hinge-on-the-definition-of-the-marketplace/&#34;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;, helpfully pinpoints the two main issues in Epic vs Apple: &amp;ldquo;What is the relevant competitive market and what should the court do if Apple is found to be unfairly monopolizing that market?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic’s case hinges on an analogy between Apple’s restrictive practices on its iOS App Store (a 30% cut, no-steering provisions, etc.) and what happened in a well-known case from US Supreme Court in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, the Court held that despite Kodak not being a dominant player in the market for photocopiers (like Apple in phones), its behaviour in the market for repair parts — restricting supply, forcing customers to buy exclusively from Kodak — was unlawfully anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Apple says: no, that’s not the right analogy. Yes, it’s true that people who want to buy apps on their iPhones or iPads are forced to use the App Store (in contrast to the the Mac, where you can get apps from App Store &lt;em&gt;and also&lt;/em&gt; from anywhere else). But iPhone customers are not like Kodak customers because if they want access to the app in question, they can simply use a different device — an Android, an Xbox, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant market, says Apple, is the whole field of device platforms competing for the world’s gamers or users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, says Epic, the relevant market is the billion or so people in the world who use an iPhone, and Apple holds them hostage just as Kodak did by wiping out the aftermarket for parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are Apple’s customers like Kodak’s customers? Or are they in a fundamentally different position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceding this to be a central question, one of Apple’s lawyers asserted: “This is not a case where there’s one device out there and if there’s a part missing you’re out of luck, you can&amp;rsquo;t use that device…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Thompson &lt;a href=&#34;https://stratechery.com/2021/app-store-arguments/&#34;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that appellate decisions have narrowed the scope of &lt;em&gt;Eastman Kodak&lt;/em&gt; to cases where customers don’t know they’re buying into a walled garden when they buy a product — and that if they do know and still freely to choose to buy the product, the company is free to reap benefits from its monopolistic position (charging higher fees, setting rules), but it cannot be anti-competitive. The company cannot prevent other parties from offering competing products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the question of analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people aren’t likely to leave the Apple ecosystem to use their favourite apps on other devices — because it’s ever harder to leave once you’re in Apple’s walled garden — are its customers not like those of Kodak? Sure, they bought their iPhone knowing it would entail submitting to Apple’s monopoly on app purchases, but did they have a real choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if Judge Gonzales Rogers — explicitly or impliedly — sees the App Store as more like the Kodak case than not and forces Apple to give users and developers some measure of choice here they didn’t have before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canada&#39;s Plan for Compelled Discoverability</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/compelled-discoverability/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 09:53:16 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/compelled-discoverability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canada may soon be the first country to pass law compelling platforms like Youtube and Tik Tok to make content created by domestic users more discoverable. Surely this can’t be constitutional, you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are passionate voices arguing both sides of this question, but they appear to be talking  past one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, Bill C-10 wouldn’t compel discovery directly; it would empower the country’s broadcast authority, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to do so, bringing Youtube and friends under the regulatory fold along with an older and very different set of entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a case that a law forcing YouTube to feature Canadian content in search results (or forcing Tik Tok to curate content streams, etc) is unconstitutional under Canada&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&lt;/em&gt;, a challenger would need to establish two things: (1) that such a law violates either a user’s freedom of expression or that of the platform itself; and (2) that the violation is not a reasonable limit on the freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for violating free expression would rest on a long-standing claim that search index results are a form of speech. It’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://robertmarksimpson.com/assets/pdfs/Search-Engines.pdf&#34;&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; claim, but not one that Canadian courts have outright dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem plausible to me to characterize what happens when I use Youtube as a kind of conversation. I express a preference in my search patterns; Youtube responds by serving me a curated set of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s courts have &lt;a href=&#34;https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1835/index.do&#34;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that free expression includes not only the right to say something but also the right to hear it. On this basis, an interruption in the conversation I have with YouTube violates the rights of both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people in favour of the Bill insist that there’s no interruption in compelling discoverability. On Monday, Janet Yale, head of the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review panel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/its-about-promotion-of-canadian-choices-academics-argue-that-bill-c-10-does-not-impede-freedom-of-speech&#34;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; a parliament committee on the bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it’s not about interfering with freedom of choice, it’s about promotion of Canadian choices … Nobody has to watch it if they don’t want to watch it. So there is actually no restriction on freedom of choice whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s wrong because the interference lies not in being forced to watch but in having the choice of what to watch interfered with. When I ask YouTube to show me content on X topic, I want the best videos in the world on X, not the best videos that happen to be Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a case for violating free expression does not seem too difficult. The fuzzier part comes in trying to predict whether a court (possibly our highest) will think this kind of limit on our rights is justified. Part of the analysis will turn on whether compelled discoverability advances a “pressing and substantial objective”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://audiencelab.fcad.ryerson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/YouTube-Full-Report-FINAL_V7_May21.pdf&#34;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; would seem to be clear that Canadian creators are doing exceedingly well on YouTube — including French Canadians &amp;ndash; with many among the most popular in their various niches. The reasonable limit case may be hard for the government to make out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ll have to wait for the lengthy, costly, and almost certainly inevitable litigation to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Governance by Data</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/governance-by-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 10:11:54 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/governance-by-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fleur Johns was kind enough to send me a pre-print copy of her new article “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-085138&#34;&gt;Governance by Data&lt;/a&gt;” in the &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Law and Social Science&lt;/em&gt;. From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and social science scholars have long elucidated ways of governing built around state governance of populations and subjects. Yet many are now grappling with the growing prevalence of practices of governance that depart, to varying degrees, from received models. The profusion of digital data, and the deployment of machine learning in its analysis, are redirecting states’ and international organizations’ attention away from the governance of populations as such and toward the amassing, analysis, and mobilization of hybrid data repositories and real-time data flows for governance. Much of this work does not depend on state data sources or on conventional statistical models. The subjectivities nurtured by these techniques of governance are frequently not those of choosing individuals. Digital objects and mediators are increasingly prevalent at all scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay makes the larger and persuasive point that the impact of data collection and use by the state is more subtle and profound in its effects on us, in many ways, than are the algorithms of our favourite platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Politics of Recognition in the Age of Social Media</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/politics-recognition-social-media/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 09:23:06 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/politics-recognition-social-media/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Davies, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii128/articles/william-davies-the-politics-of-recognition-in-the-age-of-social-media&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;New Left Review&lt;/em&gt;, explores how “transformations in the public sphere have led to a mutation in how recognition” of cultural, racial, or political identity “is demanded and supplied”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key condition for this is the digital platform, which has ushered in a new era of public participation in which recognition of status is never adequately achieved by anyone, so injustice feels ubiquitous. In the attention economy of social media, public actors may long for recognition, but have to settle instead for varying quantities of ‘reputation’, or simply the ‘reaction’ of immediate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay contains a thoughtful discussion of theories of recognition: Charles Taylor, Nancy Fraser, Alex Honneth. It also lends insight into how the “public sphere under platform capitalism differs from that of print capitalism”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…public discourse is never divorced from the identity and status of the participants, save where identity is deliberately disguised as a political tactic, for trolling. An exchange on a platform leaves a trace, which remains attached to the digital identity of both parties, and serves as a type of investment (positive or negative) in their reputations. Opinion, judgement and critique no longer exist in any autonomous form, but become mediators of social relations and investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What Comes After the Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/what-comes-after-the-internet/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 08:51:22 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/what-comes-after-the-internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ball on the coming &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in February of 2019, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite. It is also the driver behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among many, many other projects, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be spent on cloud gaming over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key features, Ball speculates, are persistence; synchronicity; concurrent participation across space; a straddling of online and offline worlds, open and closed platforms; and “unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaverse is not to be confused with “virtual reality”, “virtual space,” a game, or even “online experience itself”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will depend on a number of developments, including a greater &amp;ldquo;concurrency infrastructure&amp;rdquo; to host ever larger, mass, real-time events online; a more robust and resilient set of standards and protocols, narrowing the number of common file formats; and a more inviting set of “on-ramp experiences” to the ones that brought us online in the late 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating vision of at least some of the changes at a macro level that we can expect to see in the evolution of digital and network tech in the coming decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One insight, among many, that stands out here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Police Bodycam Use About to Rise in Canada</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 08:38:23 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of reluctance by police and government in Canada to embrace bodycams, Colin Freeze reports that things are beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His informative &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-police-are-increasingly-sold-on-bodycam-technology/&#34;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; (behind a paywall at the Globe) notes a series of changes on the ground across Canada in the wake of George Floyd&amp;rsquo;s murder, captured on video last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that occurred, Trudeau announced $50 million in funding for RCMP bodycams. Forces in Ontario have recently announced $70 million in contracts, with two of the province&amp;rsquo;s largest forces &amp;ndash; Peel and Toronto &amp;ndash; budgeting $10 and $34 million respectively for body-worn cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Freeze points out, Canada lacks law regulating the use of bodycams, giving rise to a host of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police forces that do have them must create their own policies on when video can be released. In cases of videotaped deaths and injuries, the decision will lie with provincial watchdog bodies such as Ontario’s Special Investigative Unit – which currently take months to investigate before releasing any findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forthcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3623440&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Criminal Law Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; that I co-authored with Marshall Putnam argues for &lt;em&gt;Criminal Code&lt;/em&gt; amendments that would guide police and prosecutors in the use of camera evidence &amp;ndash; when to record, disclosure, privacy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without codifying rules in federal law, camera uptake and use in Canada will be a confusing patchwork of law and practice, with unfair, inefficient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
