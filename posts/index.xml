          Gurri and Diebert present contrasting perspectives on what the network revolution means for government, and the contrast may be in large part a function of what they chose to focus on.
By focusing on street protests and civil unrest caused by mobilized and radicalized, but leaderless factions unleashed by internet communications, Gurri sees the net as a threat to centralized rule, in both democratic and authoritarian states. He believes itâ€™s only a matter of time before even the largest strong-man regimes like Russia and China succumb to the instability and ultimately the toppling of government that unfolded in places like Egypt and Tunisia, or to the installation of populist government from Hungary to Brazil to the US.
