          I have used Moodle since I began teaching in 2005. Until recently, it seemed indispensable: a free platform that made a whole repository of docs available to students. It was stable, relatively secure, easy to understand, and functional. But it’s showing its age.
Notion may be a far better tool for my purposes, and I suspect for other profs or teachers who use ‘learning management systems’ like D2L, Moodle, or Google Classroom primarily as a place to hand out slides, notes, and links.
