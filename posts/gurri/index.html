<div class=post-title> Martin Gurri, the Information Tsunami, and the Crisis of Authority</div>


          <span class="post-date">
            Wednesday, Jul 7, 2021
          </span>

        
<p><p>In the previous <a href="/posts/state-censorship/">post</a>, I wrote about recent events in India and levels of control a government can assert over the net to suppress dissent.</p>
<p>I did so with a view to exploring the larger issue of how much of a threat free speech online can pose to a national government. This in turn pointed me to what I call the Gurri-Deibert debate — a conversation I’m positing between two figures who have recently written important books on the question. Martin Gurri sees the net as a profoundly destabilizing tool of protest and dissent; Ron Deibert <a href="https://houseofanansi.com/products/reset">sees</a> it as a tool of unprecedented authoritarian control.</p>
<p>In this post, I look closer at Gurri’s arguments. There are many places to find a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22301496/martin-gurri-the-revolt-of-the-public-global-democracy">summary</a> of Gurri’s work. Here I want to foreground only a certain strain of it relevant to what Gurri calls ‘the crisis of authority.’</p>
<h3 id="first-who-is-martin-gurri">First, who is Martin Gurri?</h3>
<p>Gurri has entered the debate the about the impact of technology on politics and culture without a conventional pedigree. He is not a career journalist with bylines in prominent venues. Nor is he a credentialed academic with a series of peer-reviewed articles or books over a long career.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Revolt.jpg" alt="image alt >"></p>
<p>He was a foreign affairs analyst with the CIA who wrote <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> in his retirement, and self-published it in 2014. Based on the frequency with which it is cited in political journalism on the both the right and the left, the book appears to have gained a wide readership, resulting in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=1&amp;imprToken=f6bc32cb-fcb4-fa89-39b&amp;ascsubtag=537%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD">second edition</a> published by Stripe Press in 2018. Gurri added a post-script to that volume that is long-enough to be a book in itself.</p>
<p>The first edition from 2014 is widely credited with predicting many facets of far right populism, if not Trump and Brexit in particular. It anticipates with remarkable prescience events like the showdown at Charlottesville or the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and the rise of ‘alternative facts.’</p>
<h3 id="the-information-tsunami">The information tsunami</h3>
<p><em>The Revolt of the Public</em> has something of an autobiographical flavour, with Gurri casting the political fall-out of the internet in the light of his work as an analyst at the CIA. Before the turn of the millennium, Gurri explains, he could often glean all relevant political developments of the day in a country like Spain or France by perusing two or three of its major papers. Much of what he needed to know could be discerned authoritatively and concisely by consulting a small number of trusted sources.</p>
<p>But within short order after the birth of the web, the amount of information exploded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More information was generated in 2001 than in all the previous existence of our species on earth. In fact, 2001 doubled the previous total. And 2002 doubled the amount present in 2001, adding around 23 “exabytes” of new information—roughly the equivalent of 140,000 Library of Congress collections. Growth in information had been historically slow and additive. It was now exponential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that point, as Gurri writes, “[h]owever I conducted my research, whatever sources I chose, I was left in a state of uncertainty—a permanent condition for analysis under the new dispensation.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every presidential statement, every CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper, suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral predilection rather than intellectual rigor. When proof for and against approaches infinity, a cloud of suspicion about cherry-picking data will hang over every authoritative judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Gurri saw that “as the amount of information available to the public increased, the authoritativeness of any one source decreased.”</p>
<h3 id="the-crisis-of-authority">The crisis of authority</h3>
<p>But information explosion is not Gurri’s subject. His interest is in what the sudden abundance of data meant for a host of institutions in society, such as the press, the political party, the university, the scientific establishment, the professions — and government itself.</p>
<p>Much of <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> is devoted to showing how these bastions of authority (though mainly government and the press) had, in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, come to assume a hierarchical, top-down, bureaucratic, “industrial” form and maintained their power and place in society in large part through a scarcity or monopoly of information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current structures of authority are a legacy of the industrial age. The public, when it needs answers, turns to institutions rather than to charismatic individuals. These institutions have been subjected to a Taylorist process of rationalization: they are, without exception, top-down, specialized, professionalized, prone to pseudo-scientific rituals and jargon. To enter such a precinct of authority requires a long and costly accreditation process — years of academic education and apprenticeship. Many are called, few are chosen. The elect believe themselves to be unquestioned masters of their special domain — and so they were for many years. From the middle of the nineteenth to the end of the twentieth centuries, the public lacked the means to question, much less contradict, authoritative judgments derived from monopolies of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scarcity of information not only helped sustain the authority of these institutions, but also shaped the nature of media and public discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretty early in the game, the wave of fresh information exposed the poverty and artificiality of established arrangements. Public discussion, for example, was limited to a very few topics of interest to the articulate elites. Politics ruled despotically over the public sphere — and not just politics but Federal politics, with a peculiar fixation on the executive branch. Science, technology, religion, philosophy, the visual arts — except when they touched on some political question, these life-shaping concerns tended to be met with silence. In a similar manner, a mediocre play watched by a few thousands received reviews from critics with literary pretensions, while a computer game of breathtaking technical sophistication, played by millions, fell beneath notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new era, the formerly “passive mass audience” became “unbundled, disaggregated, [and] fragmented” into what Gurri, drawing on Walter Lippmann, calls “vital communities”, or groups of “wildly disparate size gathered organically around a shared interest or theme.” The voice of these communities was new: “that of the amateur, of the educated non-elites, of a disaffected and unruly public.”</p>
<p>Information, critique, and dissent has since exploded from a multitude of sources — visual, aural, textual — not amounting to a new media to be set against the old media but to “a single, deeply matrixed <em>information sphere.</em>”</p>
<p>The loss of information scarcity and control over messaging in the new environment challenges government and authority in new ways.</p>
<p>In the earlier “industrial” paradigm, “the pratfalls of authority had been managed discreetly, camouflaged by the mystique of the expert at the top of his game.” By contrast,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today failure happens out in the open, in public, where everyone can see. With the arrival of the global information sphere, each failure is captured, reproduced, multiplied, amplified, and made to stand for authority as a whole. Crisis has followed logically from the destruction of the persuasive power — the legitimacy and credibility — possessed by established institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a consequence, we find ourselves in the midst of a “slow-motion collision” between “two modes of organizing life: one hierarchical, industrial, and top-down, the other networked, egalitarian, bottom-up.”</p>
<p>The conflict for conventional authorities is continuous and inescapable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality of the new environment is that the global information sphere, rather than any one medium or platform, erupts into nearly every political conflict, and not infrequently helps determine the outcome. Unlike, say, TV or Facebook, the information sphere can’t be blocked by government. It’s too redundant. Information leaks into the conflict anyhow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All expert pronouncements, all efforts to govern on the basis of claims of competence or experience are met by “a horde of amateurs eager to pounce on every mistake and mock every unsuccessful prediction or policy. … Nothing is secret and nothing is sacred, so the hierarchies some time ago lost their heroic ambitions and now they have lost their nerve.”</p>
<p>The potential consequences of the collision of old and new information paradigms are far reaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Famous landmarks of the old regime, like the daily newspaper and the political party, have begun to disintegrate under the pressure of this slow-motion collision. Many features we prized about the old world are also threatened: for example, liberal democracy and economic stability. Some of them will emerge permanently distorted by the stress. Others will just disappear. Many attributes of the new dispensation, like a vastly larger sphere for public discussion, may also warp or break from the immoveable resistance of the established order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, institutional authority is coming to be superseded by the cacophony of ‘the public,’ with each pointing to a different set of values and “modes of behaviour.” Much of the social and political conflict we witness today is the conflict of these two orders.</p>
<h3 id="centre-and-border">Centre and border</h3>
<p>Gurri draws on the work of Mary Douglas and Aaron Wildavsky to situate the public-authority conflict in terms of the struggle between Center and Border.</p>
<p>The Center is “dominated by large, hierarchical organization,” committed to “rigid procedures,” and is “slow [and] too blind to new information.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Border, in contrast, is composed of “sects” — we would say “networks” —  which are voluntary associations of equals. Sects exist to oppose the Center: they stand firmly against. They have, however, “no intention of governing,” and develop “no capacity for exercising power.” Rank means inequality, hierarchy means conspiracy to the Border. Rather than articulate programs as alternatives to those of the Center, sects aim to model the behaviors demanded from the “godly or good society.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Douglas and Wildavsky write: “Making a program is a center strategy; attacking center programs on behalf of nature, God, or the world is border strategy.”</p>
<p>Gurri surveys protests in the early 2010’s (the Arab Spring, Occupy, the Indignados in Spain) as examples of the Border “striking at the forces of monopoly and centralization”. But the Border is destined to remain so: “the public in revolt… [has] no interest in governing and possess no capacity for exercising power.”</p>
<p>The Border “…can neutralize but not replace the Center. Networks can protest and overthrow, but never govern. Bureaucratic inertia confronts digital nihilism. The sum is zero.” Again: “The Center can’t bring back the industrial age. The networks can’t engender an alternative.”</p>
<p>The empowerment of groups at the border constitutes a “great reversal” that has “produced few alternatives to the ideas and ideologies that dominated the industrial age.” Instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The public rides on new technologies and platforms, but as users rather than makers: it is uninterested in leveraging technical innovation to formulate its own ideology, programs, or plans. The public opposes, but does not propose. So in the second decade of the new millennium, political arguments resemble a distorted echo of the French Revolution or Victorian England: we still quarrel in terms of <em>left</em> and <em>right,</em> <em>conservative</em> and <em>liberal,</em> even while the old landscape has been swept clean and the relevance of these venerable labels has become uncertain.</p>
<p>The lack of new alternatives, of a way out, has trapped democratic politics in a perpetual feedback loop of failure and negation. And negation, invoked from every corner and without relief, has driven the democratic process to the edge of nihilism — the belief that the status quo is so abhorrent that destruction will be a form of progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="will-the-center-hold">Will the Center hold?</h3>
<p>For Gurri, the network poses a threat to national governments as part of a broader delegitimization of centralized or institutional forms of authority on the older, industrial, hierarchical model.</p>
<p>The public as projected by national newspapers and broadcasters is transformed from a homogenous mass into a series of tribes and niches of disparate interests. And many of these groups are keen to expose all the foibles of the regime: “…police brutality, economic mismanagement, foreign policy failures, botched responses to disasters.”</p>
<p>The challenges and errors confronted by those in authority “can no longer be concealed or explained away” but are “seized on by the newly-empowered public, and placed front-and-center in open discussions.” As a result “government failure now sets the agenda.”</p>
<p>More broadly, it has become harder to discern a relationship between the information in circulation and the “stories of legitimacy” the institutions rely on: e.g., that we can trust government to lead, established media to keep us informed, and scientists and doctors to keep us safe. The network instead feeds us a constant stream of compromising confidential details, internal strife and debate, and limits or gaps in knowledge and ability.</p>
<h3 id="the-limits-of-networked-protest">The limits of networked protest</h3>
<p>But how do we assess the overall threat posed by these trends for either liberal or authoritarian regimes?</p>
<p>Gurri expresses a reluctance throughout the book to make predictions or draw inferences not clearly supported by the evidence he marshals. But in a few places, he does venture broader pronouncements about what the crisis of authority means for the future of government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he rise of Homo informaticus places governments on a razor’s edge, where any mistake, any untoward event, can draw a networked public into the streets, calling for blood. This is the situation today for authoritarian governments and liberal democracies alike. The crisis in the world that I seek to depict concerns loss of trust in government, writ large. The mass extinction of stories of legitimacy leaves no margin for error, no residual store of public good will. Any spark can blow up any political system at any time, anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one passage, Gurri confronts skepticism (on the part of Malcolm Gladwell, among others) about the strength of the online opposition for authoritarian regimes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course dictatorships wish to spy on dissidents, just as dissidents seek to avoid detection—a game made vastly more difficult for those in power by the proliferation of digital hiding-places. Of course dictatorships wish to manipulate media of all kinds to influence opinion. In the industrial age, however, they did so boldly and officially, from authority, while under the new dispensation despots must try to impersonate the public to have any hope of influencing it. Instead of injecting slogans into the brains of the masses by means of banner headlines on People’s Daily or a televised speech of the lider maximo, they are now forced to ride the tiger of real opinion, and face the consequences should it turn against them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But ultimately, Gurri sees the public and conventional authorities at a stand-off, and the present as a transitional period without an obvious pending outcome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A churning, highly redundant information sphere has taken shape near at hand to ordinary persons yet beyond the reach of modern government. In the tectonic depths of social and political life, the balance of power has fundamentally shifted between authority and obedience, ruler and ruled, elite and public, so that each can inflict damage on the other but neither can attain a decisive advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gurri is, of course, not the first to analyze the impact of network technology on society at a high altitude. Many others have come before: Castells, Benkler, Rushkoff, Carr, Weinberger, Shirky, Kelly — to name but a few.</p>
<p>Gurri credits his predecessors and is humble about the nature of his contribution. But it’s significant. Strains of his arguments can be found in much of the earlier literature, but no earlier work on the internet revolution with which I am familiar goes as far to shed light on its meaning for politics and authority per se.</p>
