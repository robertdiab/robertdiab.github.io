      <p>Gurri and Diebert present contrasting perspectives on what the network revolution means for government, and the contrast may be in large part a function of what they chose to focus on.</p>
<p>By focusing on street protests and civil unrest caused by mobilized and radicalized, but leaderless factions unleashed by internet communications, Gurri sees the net as a threat to centralized rule, in both democratic and authoritarian states. He believes it’s only a matter of time before even the largest strong-man regimes like Russia and China succumb to the instability and ultimately the toppling of government that unfolded in places like Egypt and Tunisia, or to the installation of populist government from Hungary to Brazil to the US. On this view, network tech can be harnessed by authoritarians for limited purposes, but the tide of history favours the unruly, angry, fragmented, tribalized publics now in constant and irrepressible opposition to government.</p>
<p>By contrast, Diebart has focused on technologies of surveillance, repression, sabotage, censorship, and assassination to paint a picture of a future in which authoritarian governments have become vastly more effective in carrying out repression and censorship to silence, squelch, or deter opposition — suggesting that centralized, elite authority in large parts of the world has only become stronger with network technology; more tyrannical, more daunting to unseat.</p>
<p>Tentative thesis: each author’s vision is less an accurate symptom of essential powers or limitations of centralized, hierarchical authority or elites in the age of the network than partial facets of the problem from different geographical perspectives. What looks, across the west, to be the twilight of all forms of centralized authority based on industrial-age communication and information monopolies, is exposed — in the course of this comparison with Deibart’s authoritarian portrait — to be less a function of a loss of control over speech than a function of a system premised on free speech, expression, and individual freedom taken to radical extremes of individual empowerment. Conversely, Deibert’s pending catastrophe of authoritarian takeover seems overstated in light of Gurri’s insights about the power of information in the hands of a fractured public. China’s strength and stability are important counter-factuals for Gurri, but may be overestimated in Diebert’s thinking.</p>
