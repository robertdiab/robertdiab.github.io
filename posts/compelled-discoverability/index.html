<p><p>Canada may soon be the first country to pass law compelling platforms like Youtube and Tik Tok to make content created by domestic users more discoverable. Surely this can’t be constitutional, you might think.</p>
<p>There are passionate voices arguing both sides of this question, but they appear to be talking  past one another.</p>
<p>To be more precise, Bill C-10 wouldn’t compel discovery directly; it would empower the country’s broadcast authority, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to do so, bringing Youtube and friends under the regulatory fold along with an older and very different set of entities.</p>
<p>To make a case that a law forcing YouTube to feature Canadian content in search results (or forcing Tik Tok to curate content streams, etc) is unconstitutional under Canada&rsquo;s <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, a challenger would need to establish two things: (1) that such a law violates either a user’s freedom of expression or that of the platform itself; and (2) that the violation is not a reasonable limit on the freedom.</p>
<p>The case for violating free expression would rest on a long-standing claim that search index results are a form of speech. It’s a <a href="https://robertmarksimpson.com/assets/pdfs/Search-Engines.pdf">contested</a> claim, but not one that Canadian courts have outright dismissed.</p>
<p>It would seem plausible to me to characterize what happens when I use Youtube as a kind of conversation. I express a preference in my search patterns; Youtube responds by serving me a curated set of choices.</p>
<p>Canada’s courts have <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1835/index.do">suggested</a> that free expression includes not only the right to say something but also the right to hear it. On this basis, an interruption in the conversation I have with YouTube violates the rights of both parties.</p>
<p>But people in favour of the Bill insist that there’s no interruption in compelling discoverability. On Monday, Janet Yale, head of the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review panel, <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/its-about-promotion-of-canadian-choices-academics-argue-that-bill-c-10-does-not-impede-freedom-of-speech">told</a> a parliament committee on the bill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…it’s not about interfering with freedom of choice, it’s about promotion of Canadian choices … Nobody has to watch it if they don’t want to watch it. So there is actually no restriction on freedom of choice whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She’s wrong because the interference lies not in being forced to watch but in having the choice of what to watch interfered with. When I ask YouTube to show me content on X topic, I want the best videos in the world on X, not the best videos that happen to be Canadian.</p>
<p>Establishing a case for violating free expression does not seem too difficult. The fuzzier part comes in trying to predict whether a court (possibly our highest) will think this kind of limit on our rights is justified. Part of the analysis will turn on whether compelled discoverability advances a “pressing and substantial objective”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://audiencelab.fcad.ryerson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/YouTube-Full-Report-FINAL_V7_May21.pdf">evidence</a> would seem to be clear that Canadian creators are doing exceedingly well on YouTube — including French Canadians &ndash; with many among the most popular in their various niches. The reasonable limit case may be hard for the government to make out.</p>
<p>But we’ll have to wait for the lengthy, costly, and almost certainly inevitable litigation to find out.</p>
