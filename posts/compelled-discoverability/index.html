<p><p>Canada’s Parliamentarians are debating a bill that could have profound effects on the way Canadians use the internet.</p>
<p>Much of the controversy about Bill C-10 thus far has concerned its potential bring user generated content on sites like Instagram and YouTube under the regulatory thumb of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).</p>
<p>But the Bill poses a more serious threat on another front.</p>
<p>It will enable the CRTC to force platforms like YouTube and Tik Tok to promote Canadian content to Canadian users, to make it more “discoverable.”</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/open-letters/open-letter-to-government-of-canada/">fear</a> that this could skew search results or the content we stream, jeopardizing the open and global nature of the net.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/failing-analysis-why-the-department-of-justice-updated-charter-statement-doesnt-address-bill-c-10s-free-speech-risks/">surmising</a> that the change would be unconstitutional, as a violation of both our freedom of expression and that of a site like YouTube itself.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-youtube-search-amount-to-speech">How does Youtube search amount to speech?</h3>
<p>Courts in <a href="https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol56/iss2/1/">Canada</a> and around the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2246486">world</a> have long held that search index results can be forms of expression that can engage the right to free speech.</p>
<p>Large platforms like YouTube and Instagram feature content by individuals on the basis of algorithms that are never fully understood — allowing some content to gain millions of views or go viral in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>But their primary aim is to tailor the content shown to us — in search results or in content streams (on Twitter, Tik Tok) — in a way that is likely to be a good match given our consumption patterns.</p>
<p>In this way, platforms converse with us. YouTube asks me: “What sort of stuff are you interested in?” — and I respond by clicking on certain thumbnails and not others, forming a pattern. (So many gadget reviews!) YouTube’s curated response constitutes an implied statement.</p>
<p>We all know we’re having this conversation with platforms, despite the often negative effects (the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309214/the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser/">filter bubble</a> on Google; the blandness of recommendations on Spotify).</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s good to disrupt the tendency of large platforms to tailor content to our tastes. The further we follow recommendations on YouTube, the more fringe or extreme the content becomes.</p>
<p>Yet, for most people, most of the time, the tailoring that big platforms provide to us is a service — or at least a form of communication — that until now, we have been free to enjoy. And to work well, YouTube has to be free to show me content from anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3 id="bill-c-10s-unruly-interruption">Bill C-10’s unruly interruption</h3>
<p>The Bill would disrupt this conversation by forcing YouTube and other sites to show me not more of what I like — wherever on the web it might come from — but more of what I like that happens to be Canadian.</p>
<p>That is a significant intrusion on our conversation. And it affects not only YouTube&rsquo;s freedom of expression, but also mine.</p>
<p>Canadian courts have <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1835/index.do">suggested</a> that the freedom of expression includes not only the freedom to say something but also the freedom to hear it.</p>
<p>Cultural policies in the age of broadcast technology allowed for Canadian content to be promoted over foreign content, but the context was different.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, when the <em>Broadcast Act</em> was last amended, you could reasonably assume that we’d be overwhelmed by Hollywood, American Billboard, and so on, if we didn’t have law protecting Canadian content, given the economics around producing films, music, and books before the digital age.</p>
<p>But in the age of the network, on large platforms like YouTube, Canadian creators have less to fear. Without Bill C-10 forcing YouTube or Twitter to show me more Canadian content, I will not be overwhelmed by predominantly American content. Our online diet is more geographically diverse than it was in the age of broadcast.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/05/14/heritage-minister-should-carry-through-with-ambitious-agenda-to-tame-big-tech.html">argue</a> that French-Canadian creators still need protection and support from Ottawa, and that in their case, the need is pressing enough to justify limits on free expression.</p>
<p>Courts will make the final decision, and much depends on how the CRTC chooses to exercise its new powers. But it’s hard to see how the two goals can be reconciled: favouring Canadian content or preserving the open and global nature of the web as a source for the content you seek.</p>
<p>The government should abandon its nationalistic content promotion plans as bad policy and likely unconstitutional. I say this for reasons that have nothing to do with the fact that YouTube’s single most popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy">tech reviewer</a> happens to be Canadian.</p>
