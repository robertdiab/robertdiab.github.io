      <p>Much of the discussion at the moment among my colleagues at the university is about what life will look like come the fall of 2021. To what extent will we make a full return to campus? How soon will we return to normal? Or will teaching in person never be the same?</p>
<p><em>A year of serendipitous discoveries</em></p>
<p>I’m probably not alone in having had the experience over the past year of making a series of serendipitous discoveries that helped improve my workflow as a teacher, if not my effectiveness. Covid forced us to do things differently, to experiment.</p>
<p>I learned how to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjVkLxQh2Z0">videos</a> explaining discrete concepts and ideas in my teaching. I learned how to use video recordings to deliver lectures and spent more time working with my students in person on case-studies and fact patterns that gave them a chance to test their understanding.</p>
<p>I adapted to the idea of recording my live lectures and came to appreciate having them to look back at after a class I didn’t feel good about. I always felt better going over a segment I thought I didn’t do a great job with. It was also a resource students seemed to value.</p>
<p><em>What will we keep</em></p>
<p>A few colleagues have told me they intend to hold onto to at least some facets of the flipped classroom. One suggested he never wants to hold live lectures again — video seems best for this. I’m on the fence on this one. I see the benefits to both live and recorded lectures.</p>
<p>One approach might be to keep the recorded lectures for my upper-year Evidence course, but do brief 10 to 15 minute summaries of the main ideas in person, before launching into a fact-pattern problem we would do together. This could lead to a smoother workflow around teaching. I would polish up or re-do my videos from last fall that I made earlier in the term, when I was new at it. But I would keep the ones from roughly mid-way through the term, which were much better. I could then focus on prepping better exercises and problem questions.</p>
<p>It also seems likely that whatever we choose to do in person or live with students next year, everything will likely have to be recorded given the uncertainty around who will be able to attend. This makes some form of hybrid teaching inevitable.</p>
<p>And the longer we take this approach, the more likely it is to become a lasting part of our teaching.</p>
