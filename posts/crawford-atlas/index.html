<p><p>I’m reading and a learning a lot from Kate Crawford’s <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300209570/atlas-ai">Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence</a> (Yale, 2021). It might be grouped with earlier books that give us a glimpse of the underside of computing, the hidden material conditions. Books like Andrew Blum’s <a href="https://www.andrewblum.net/tubes-2">Tubes: A Journey to the Centre of the Internet</a> (Ecco, 2012) or the Tung-Hui Hu’s <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/prehistory-cloud">A Prehistory of the Cloud</a> (MIT, 2015).</p>
<p>Crawford’s title is misleading. It’s not a book about artificial intelligence; it’s about computation in the abstract — all forms of it: PC, mobil, mainframe, network, etc. She’s concerned with planetary environmental and social costs that remain hidden in much of our experience of technology, and in the stories of progress we tell about it. Her thesis (from the Introduction):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I argue that AI is neither artificial nor intelligent. Rather, artificial intelligence is both embodied and material, made from natural resources, fuel, human labor, infrastructures, logistics, histories, and classifications. AI systems are not autonomous, rational, or able to discern anything without extensive, computationally intensive training with large datasets or predefined rules and rewards. In fact, artificial intelligence as we know it depends entirely on a much wider set of political and social structures. And due to the capital required to build AI at scale and the ways of seeing that it optimizes AI systems are ultimately designed to serve existing dominant interests. In this sense, artificial intelligence is a registry of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crawford sees AI (or computation) as the product of a series of “economic, political, cultural, and historical forces”. Her aim is to “connect AI within these broader structures and social systems,”  so as to “escape the notion that artificial intelligence is a purely technical domain.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a fundamental level, AI is technical and social practices, institutions and infrastructures, politics and culture. Computational reason and embodied work are deeply interlinked: AI systems both reflect and produce social relations and understandings of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to why she chose the metaphor of an atlas as a framework, Crawford explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By invoking an atlas, I’m suggesting that we need new ways to understand the empires of artificial intelligence. We need a theory of AI that accounts for the states and corporations that drive and dominate it, the extractive min- ing that leaves an imprint on the planet, the mass capture of data, and the profoundly unequal and increasingly exploitative labor practices that sustain it. These are the shifting tectonics of power in AI. A topographical approach offers different perspectives and scales, beyond the abstract promises of artificial intelligence or the latest machine learning models. The aim is to understand AI in a wider context by walking through the many different landscapes of computation and seeing how they connect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m only through two of the chapters thus far. The one on the environmental impact of AI’s tendency toward ‘extraction’ was eye-opening. Producing a laptop battery, let alone one for a Tesla or a Ford 150, involves an enormous amount of permanent waste and destruction through lithium mining. But it&rsquo;s in keeping, as Crawford shows, with a long tradition of network tech doing serious environmental damage that extends at least as far back as the telegraph.</p>
<p>The chapter on labour draws interesting parallels between “the repetitive motions of robots and line machinery” and the “controlling of bodies in space and time” in the work farmed out to gig workers by Amazon, Facebook, and others.</p>
<p>Other chapters explore data harvesting in AI, prediction algorithms, and their use in state power. As a bonus, Crawford writes with journalistic flair and moves fluidly through well-chosen historical anecdotes. Can’t put it down.</p>
