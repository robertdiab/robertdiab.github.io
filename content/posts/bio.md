I am a professor in the [Faculty of Law](https://www.tru.ca/law.html) at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia.

I write about law and technology.

My writing has appeared in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Salon, and the National Interest, among other venues.

I have also written scholarship on human rights and civil liberties, and more recently on topics that include internet governance, compelled decryption, and digital privacy.
