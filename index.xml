      <title>Canada&#39;s Plan for Compelled Discoverability</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/compelled-discoverability/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Parliamentarians are debating a bill that could have profound effects on the way Canadians use the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the controversy about Bill C-10 thus far has concerned its potential bring user generated content on sites like Instagram and YouTube under the regulatory thumb of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Bill poses a more serious threat on another front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will enable the CRTC to force platforms like YouTube and Tik Tok to promote Canadian content to Canadian users, to make it more “discoverable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.internetsociety.org/open-letters/open-letter-to-government-of-canada/&#34;&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; that this could skew search results or the content we stream, jeopardizing the open and global nature of the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not alone in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/failing-analysis-why-the-department-of-justice-updated-charter-statement-doesnt-address-bill-c-10s-free-speech-risks/&#34;&gt;surmising&lt;/a&gt; that the change would be unconstitutional, as a violation of both our freedom of expression and that of a site like YouTube itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-youtube-search-amount-to-speech&#34;&gt;How does Youtube search amount to speech?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts in &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol56/iss2/1/&#34;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2246486&#34;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; have long held that search index results can be forms of expression that can engage the right to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large platforms like YouTube and Instagram feature content by individuals on the basis of algorithms that are never fully understood — allowing some content to gain millions of views or go viral in unpredictable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their primary aim is to tailor the content shown to us — in search results or in content streams (on Twitter, Tik Tok) — in a way that is likely to be a good match given our consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, platforms converse with us. YouTube asks me: “What sort of stuff are you interested in?” — and I respond by clicking on certain thumbnails and not others, forming a pattern. (So many gadget reviews!) YouTube’s curated response constitutes an implied statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know we’re having this conversation with platforms, despite the often negative effects (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309214/the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser/&#34;&gt;filter bubble&lt;/a&gt; on Google; the blandness of recommendations on Spotify).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s good to disrupt the tendency of large platforms to tailor content to our tastes. The further we follow recommendations on YouTube, the more fringe or extreme the content becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, for most people, most of the time, the tailoring that big platforms provide to us is a service — or at least a form of communication — that until now, we have been free to enjoy. And to work well, YouTube has to be free to show me content from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bill-c-10s-unruly-interruption&#34;&gt;Bill C-10’s unruly interruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill would disrupt this conversation by forcing YouTube and other sites to show me not more of what I like — wherever on the web it might come from — but more of what I like that happens to be Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a significant intrusion on our conversation. And it affects not only YouTube&amp;rsquo;s freedom of expression, but also mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian courts have &lt;a href=&#34;https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1835/index.do&#34;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the freedom of expression includes not only the freedom to say something but also the freedom to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural policies in the age of broadcast technology allowed for Canadian content to be promoted over foreign content, but the context was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, when the &lt;em&gt;Broadcast Act&lt;/em&gt; was last amended, you could reasonably assume that we’d be overwhelmed by Hollywood, American Billboard, and so on, if we didn’t have law protecting Canadian content, given the economics around producing films, music, and books before the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the age of the network, on large platforms like YouTube, Canadian creators have less to fear. Without Bill C-10 forcing YouTube or Twitter to show me more Canadian content, I will not be overwhelmed by predominantly American content. Our online diet is more geographically diverse than it was in the age of broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2021/05/14/heritage-minister-should-carry-through-with-ambitious-agenda-to-tame-big-tech.html&#34;&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that French-Canadian creators still need protection and support from Ottawa, and that in their case, the need is pressing enough to justify limits on free expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts will make the final decision, and much depends on how the CRTC chooses to exercise its new powers. But it’s hard to see how the two goals can be reconciled: favouring Canadian content or preserving the open and global nature of the web as a source for the content you seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government should abandon its nationalistic content promotion plans as bad policy and likely unconstitutional. I say this for reasons that have nothing to do with the fact that YouTube’s single most popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy&#34;&gt;tech reviewer&lt;/a&gt; happens to be Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Governance by Data</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/governance-by-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 10:11:54 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/governance-by-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fleur Johns was kind enough to send me a pre-print copy of her new article “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-085138&#34;&gt;Governance by Data&lt;/a&gt;” in the &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Law and Social Science&lt;/em&gt;. From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and social science scholars have long elucidated ways of governing built around state governance of populations and subjects. Yet many are now grappling with the growing prevalence of practices of governance that depart, to varying degrees, from received models. The profusion of digital data, and the deployment of machine learning in its analysis, are redirecting states’ and international organizations’ attention away from the governance of populations as such and toward the amassing, analysis, and mobilization of hybrid data repositories and real-time data flows for governance. Much of this work does not depend on state data sources or on conventional statistical models. The subjectivities nurtured by these techniques of governance are frequently not those of choosing individuals. Digital objects and mediators are increasingly prevalent at all scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay makes the larger and persuasive point that the impact of data collection and use by the state is more subtle and profound in its effects on us, in many ways, than are the algorithms of our favourite platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Politics of Recognition in the Age of Social Media</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/politics-recognition-social-media/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 09:23:06 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/politics-recognition-social-media/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Davies, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii128/articles/william-davies-the-politics-of-recognition-in-the-age-of-social-media&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;New Left Review&lt;/em&gt;, explores how “transformations in the public sphere have led to a mutation in how recognition” of cultural, racial, or political identity “is demanded and supplied”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key condition for this is the digital platform, which has ushered in a new era of public participation in which recognition of status is never adequately achieved by anyone, so injustice feels ubiquitous. In the attention economy of social media, public actors may long for recognition, but have to settle instead for varying quantities of ‘reputation’, or simply the ‘reaction’ of immediate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay contains a thoughtful discussion of theories of recognition: Charles Taylor, Nancy Fraser, Alex Honneth. It also lends insight into how the “public sphere under platform capitalism differs from that of print capitalism”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…public discourse is never divorced from the identity and status of the participants, save where identity is deliberately disguised as a political tactic, for trolling. An exchange on a platform leaves a trace, which remains attached to the digital identity of both parties, and serves as a type of investment (positive or negative) in their reputations. Opinion, judgement and critique no longer exist in any autonomous form, but become mediators of social relations and investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What Comes After the Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/what-comes-after-the-internet/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 08:51:22 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/what-comes-after-the-internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ball on the coming &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in February of 2019, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite. It is also the driver behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among many, many other projects, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be spent on cloud gaming over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key features, Ball speculates, are persistence; synchronicity; concurrent participation across space; a straddling of online and offline worlds, open and closed platforms; and “unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaverse is not to be confused with “virtual reality”, “virtual space,” a game, or even “online experience itself”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will depend on a number of developments, including a greater &amp;ldquo;concurrency infrastructure&amp;rdquo; to host ever larger, mass, real-time events online; a more robust and resilient set of standards and protocols, narrowing the number of common file formats; and a more inviting set of “on-ramp experiences” to the ones that brought us online in the late 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating vision of at least some of the changes at a macro level that we can expect to see in the evolution of digital and network tech in the coming decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One insight, among many, that stands out here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Police Bodycam Use About to Rise in Canada</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 08:38:23 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of reluctance by police and government in Canada to embrace bodycams, Colin Freeze reports that things are beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His informative &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-police-are-increasingly-sold-on-bodycam-technology/&#34;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; (behind a paywall at the Globe) notes a series of changes on the ground across Canada in the wake of George Floyd&amp;rsquo;s murder, captured on video last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that occurred, Trudeau announced $50 million in funding for RCMP bodycams. Forces in Ontario have recently announced $70 million in contracts, with two of the province&amp;rsquo;s largest forces &amp;ndash; Peel and Toronto &amp;ndash; budgeting $10 and $34 million respectively for body-worn cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Freeze points out, Canada lacks law regulating the use of bodycams, giving rise to a host of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police forces that do have them must create their own policies on when video can be released. In cases of videotaped deaths and injuries, the decision will lie with provincial watchdog bodies such as Ontario’s Special Investigative Unit – which currently take months to investigate before releasing any findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forthcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3623440&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Criminal Law Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; that I co-authored with Marshall Putnam argues for &lt;em&gt;Criminal Code&lt;/em&gt; amendments that would guide police and prosecutors in the use of camera evidence &amp;ndash; when to record, disclosure, privacy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without codifying rules in federal law, camera uptake and use in Canada will be a confusing patchwork of law and practice, with unfair, inefficient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
