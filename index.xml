      <title>Governance by Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fleur Johns was kind enough to send me a pre-print copy of her new article “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-085138&#34;&gt;Governance by Data&lt;/a&gt;” in the &lt;em&gt;Annual Review of Law and Social Science&lt;/em&gt;. From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and social science scholars have long elucidated ways of governing built around state governance of populations and subjects. Yet many are now grappling with the growing prevalence of practices of governance that depart, to varying degrees, from received models. The profusion of digital data, and the deployment of machine learning in its analysis, are redirecting states’ and international organizations’ attention away from the governance of populations as such and toward the amassing, analysis, and mobilization of hybrid data repositories and real-time data flows for governance. Much of this work does not depend on state data sources or on conventional statistical models. The subjectivities nurtured by these techniques of governance are frequently not those of choosing individuals. Digital objects and mediators are increasingly prevalent at all scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay makes the larger and persuasive point that the impact of data collection and use by the state is more subtle and profound in its effects on us, in many ways, than are the algorithms of our favourite platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Politics of Recognition in the Age of Social Media</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/politics-recognition-social-media/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Davies, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii128/articles/william-davies-the-politics-of-recognition-in-the-age-of-social-media&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;New Left Review&lt;/em&gt;, explores how “transformations in the public sphere have led to a mutation in how recognition” of cultural, racial, or political identity “is demanded and supplied”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key condition for this is the digital platform, which has ushered in a new era of public participation in which recognition of status is never adequately achieved by anyone, so injustice feels ubiquitous. In the attention economy of social media, public actors may long for recognition, but have to settle instead for varying quantities of ‘reputation’, or simply the ‘reaction’ of immediate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay contains a thoughtful discussion of theories of recognition: Charles Taylor, Nancy Fraser, Alex Honneth. It also lends insight into how the “public sphere under platform capitalism differs from that of print capitalism”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…public discourse is never divorced from the identity and status of the participants, save where identity is deliberately disguised as a political tactic, for trolling. An exchange on a platform leaves a trace, which remains attached to the digital identity of both parties, and serves as a type of investment (positive or negative) in their reputations. Opinion, judgement and critique no longer exist in any autonomous form, but become mediators of social relations and investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What Comes After the Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/what-comes-after-the-internet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ball on the coming &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse&#34;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in February of 2019, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the Unreal Engine and Fortnite. It is also the driver behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among many, many other projects, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be spent on cloud gaming over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key features, Ball speculates, are persistence; synchronicity; concurrent participation across space; a straddling of online and offline worlds, open and closed platforms; and “unprecedented interoperability of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaverse is not to be confused with “virtual reality”, “virtual space,” a game, or even “online experience itself”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will depend on a number of developments, including a greater &amp;ldquo;concurrency infrastructure&amp;rdquo; to host ever larger, mass, real-time events online; a more robust and resilient set of standards and protocols, narrowing the number of common file formats; and a more inviting set of “on-ramp experiences” to the ones that brought us online in the late 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating vision of at least some of the changes at a macro level that we can expect to see in the evolution of digital and network tech in the coming decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One insight, among many, that stands out here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;it won’t directly come into existence; there will be no clean “Before Metaverse” and “After Metaverse”. Instead, it will slowly emerge over time as different products, services, and capabilities integrate and meld together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Police Bodycam Use About to Rise in Canada</title>
      <link>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 08:38:23 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.robertdiab.ca/posts/uptake-police-bodycams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of reluctance by police and government in Canada to embrace bodycams, Colin Freeze reports that things are beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His informative &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-police-are-increasingly-sold-on-bodycam-technology/&#34;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; (behind a paywall at the Globe) notes a series of changes on the ground across Canada in the wake of George Floyd&amp;rsquo;s murder, captured on video last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that occurred, Trudeau announced $50 million in funding for RCMP bodycams. Forces in Ontario have recently announced $70 million in contracts, with two of the province&amp;rsquo;s largest forces &amp;ndash; Peel and Toronto &amp;ndash; budgeting $10 and $34 million respectively for body-worn cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Freeze points out, Canada lacks law regulating the use of bodycams, giving rise to a host of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police forces that do have them must create their own policies on when video can be released. In cases of videotaped deaths and injuries, the decision will lie with provincial watchdog bodies such as Ontario’s Special Investigative Unit – which currently take months to investigate before releasing any findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forthcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3623440&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Criminal Law Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; that I co-authored with Marshall Putnam argues for &lt;em&gt;Criminal Code&lt;/em&gt; amendments that would guide police and prosecutors in the use of camera evidence &amp;ndash; when to record, disclosure, privacy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without codifying rules in federal law, camera uptake and use in Canada will be a confusing patchwork of law and practice, with unfair, inefficient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
